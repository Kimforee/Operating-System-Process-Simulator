# Operating-System-Simulator
OS Simulator: Qt GUI with OS concepts like FCFS Scheduling | Memory Allocation | Deadlock Detection. Experience real-time process management and memory handling through an desktop app.
Project Description:
Operating System (OS) simulation an desktop application designed with a sleek and intuitive GUI using the Qt framework, this project seamlessly integrates powerful backend functionalities to provide an in-depth understanding of OS processes.
Features:
üöÄ Dynamic Simulation: Our desktop app kickstarts process simulation with a single click, emulating various algorithms including FCFS, Best Fit memory allocation, and Banker's algorithm.

üí° Intuitive Interface: A familiar "Start" button, akin to the Windows interface, initiates the simulation. A list of OS projects emerges upon selection, and with a simple click, a simulation window opens.

üñ•Ô∏è Realistic Visualization: Witness the simulation's realism as it displays process details such as memory usage, completion time, deadlock occurrences, turnaround time, waiting time, available resources, and initial burst and arrival times.

üîÑ Dynamic Resource Management: The app dynamically manages resources, ensuring optimal utilization and minimizing conflicts. Processes are randomly selected, adding an element of unpredictability.
Project Highlights:
By merging the power of C++ programming with Qt's versatility, this project redefines OS simulation. Its implementation of FCFS scheduling, Best Fit memory allocation, and Banker's algorithm for deadlock detection elevates the simulation's accuracy and educational value. The project's user-friendly interface and comprehensive visualizations provide an immersive learning experience in OS concepts.
